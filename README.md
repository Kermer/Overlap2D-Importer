## Overlap2D Importer
Plugin for importing projects from Overlap2D into Godot

Currently only allows to import images
( no composites, lights, particles, polygons )

Usage:
1. Drop folder with plugin.cfg into your Godot plugins folder ( %app_data%/Godot/plugins for windows, ~/.godot/plugins for Linux ? )

2. Enable at editor settings
3. Press 'Importer' button on top of your 2D scene editor
4. Navigate to 'project.dt' file

This is really early version of importer, so it should contain some bugs.
